# JavaScript AST Converter

## Introduction

A simple demo that converts redundant `Abstract Syntax Tree` generated by `esprima` into a simpler tree-structure.

For Example, a node of `VariableDeclarator` is as follow.
```json
{
    "id": {
        "name": "x",
        "type": "Identifier"
    },
    "init": null,
    "type": "VariableDeclarator"
}
```
Here we simplify it following these rules.

1. Each node has only two members, `node` and `children`.
2. In general, assign `node` with `type`, and `children` with the rest.
3. Ignore `string`, `boolean`, `null` members.

The we have
```json
{
    "node": "VariableDeclarator",
    "children": [
        {
            "node": "Identifier",
            "children": [
                {
                    "node": "a",
                    "children": []
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
